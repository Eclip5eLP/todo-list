This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

## Info

WIP

## Usage

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Next start the api by running `node server.js` inside the restApi folder.
The api and the server should be running now.
